# 🧼 CleanQuest

> **Crowdsourcing a Cleaner Tomorrow**
>
> A platform that empowers citizens to report waste sites, enables NGOs to take action, and leverages AI to verify impact. CleanQuest gamifies cleanup efforts, ranks NGOs on a public leaderboard, and lets funders support verified impact.

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

CleanQuest bridges the gap between community waste reporting and real-world cleanup efforts. Here's how it works:

1. **Citizens Upload Waste Images** 📸  
2. **NGOs Accept and Clean the Site** 🧹  
3. **AI Compares Before/After Photos** 🤖  
4. **NGOs Earn Points Based on Cleanup Quality** 🏆  
5. **Funders Support Verified NGOs** 💰
